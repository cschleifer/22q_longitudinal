# 22q_longitudinal
Analysis of age-related trajectories for functional network connectivity in 22qDel and typical controls. 

## Overview

## Dependencies
* requires wb_command for ciftiTools functions that read/plot MRI data. 
  * download: https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench
  * script expects the workbench directory to be `/Applications/workbench/bin_macosx64` (either download to this location, or edit the path in the script)
* to read fMRI results from the hoffman2 server, the script expects that the server (`hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:/u/project/cbearden/data`) is mounted to your local machine using an application such as SSHFS (mac download: https://osxfuse.github.io/)
